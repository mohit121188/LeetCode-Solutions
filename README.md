# LeetCode-Solutions
Repository containing my solutions to LeetCode coding problems.

<b>Problem 1:</b> https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
<br>Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

<b>Problem 2:</b> https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
<br>Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

<b>Problem 3:</b> https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/
<br>Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

<b>Problem 4:</b> https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/
<br>Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

<b>Problem 5:</b> https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/
<br>Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

<b>Problem 6:</b>https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/
<br>Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number. Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list. The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

<b>Problem 7:</b>https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/
<br>Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

<b>Problem 8:</b>https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/
<br>Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.
